Welcome to the URL Shortener project! This project was developed as part of my school internship at namespace.media. The goal of this project was to learn and apply Fullstack development concepts using various tools and technologies including TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

The URL Shortener is a web application that allows users to shorten long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface to enter a long URL, which is then transformed into a shorter version. Users can share these shortened URLs and they will be redirected to the original long URL when clicked.
